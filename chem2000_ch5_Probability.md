## Continuous Distributions

So far, the events we have encountered have discrete outcomes, such as obtaining heads or tails when tossing a coin.
However, some events correspond to continuous outcomes.

For example, imagine spinning an arrow (see figure on the left). The resulting angle, ϕ, at which the arrow stops is not a discrete value; it can take any value in the continuous range 
[0,2π].

If there is no external influence that makes the arrow prefer one direction over another, then the probability of the arrow pointing at any given angle must be equal.

We introduce a function ρ(ϕ) to represent the probability density, or propensity, of the arrow pointing at angle ϕ.
A higher value of ρ(ϕ) indicates a greater likelihood of the arrow pointing near that angle.

The total probability over all possible directions must be 1:
